In this code:

The Flask web framework is used to create a simple web server.
When a POST request is received at the /webhook endpoint, the function webhook_handler() is called.
The event type is extracted from the request headers, and you should implement security checks (such as comparing SECRET_KEY) to ensure the request is legitimate.
Depending on the event type (in this example, we're handling the "push" event), you can customize the code to trigger specific scripts. In this case, we're triggering main.sh.
The subprocess.run() function is used to execute the shell script.
The server runs on IP address 0.0.0.0 and port 8080.
Remember that this code is a basic example and lacks the necessary security measures. For production use, you must implement proper authentication, payload validation, and error handling to ensure the webhook's security and reliability.
